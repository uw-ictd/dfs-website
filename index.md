title: Digital Financial Services (DFS)
---

The Digital Financial Services Research Group (DFSRG) investigates technologies that improve the ability of banks and mobile operators to deploy Digital Financial Service (DFS) products that reach the poor. 

Low profitability, lack of client demand, and the outright failure of many DFS launches can be traced back to difficult barriers and frictions that hinder the business model and scalability of DFS systems. 

Many of these barriers and frictions could be addressed by high potential emerging technologies but often the requisite translation of these technologies from the lab or from other sectors into usable tools for the DFS space is not happening with the necessary urgency.

Our goal is to develop and deploy technological solutions to specific challenges that impede the introduction and wide scale deployment of digital financial services.
