### Human Computer Interaction (HCI)

It is challenging to design technologies using standard HCI methods for marginalized communities because they face a complex array of socioeconomic barriers, literacy constraints and infrastructural challenges. There are enormous research opportunities at the intersection of HCI and ICTD.  HCI research in our group focuses on: 1) Understanding how technologies are impacting lives of marginalized communities in developing regions and 2) Designing, building and evaluating low-cost technological solutions for underserved communities to provide them access to health, education, civic engagement, crowdsourcing systems and social media platforms. We use several technology designs including text messages, speech-based interfaces, and low-cost usable smartphone applications to realize our goal. Some of our past research includes designing a voice-based social media platform for low-income low-literate people in India, digitizing paper-based global development data using a smartphone application, engaging pregnant women in Kenya with a hybrid computer-human SMS communication system, and analyzing diagnostic tests for infectious disease using a smartphone application. Our technology interventions are deployed in several countries in Southeast Asia and the African continent including India, Pakistan, Kenya, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Mali, Somalia.
