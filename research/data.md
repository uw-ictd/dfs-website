### Data Analytics

Data analytics can enable organizations to make better decisions and gain useful insights. Therefore, data digitalization has been the focus of governments and global development agencies for the past decade, but many of these efforts have been hindered with inconsistent formats and data quality issues. Organizations need tools to help them understand and analyze their data coming from various sources to avoid investing large amounts of time manually cleaning and aligning these datasets. Our lab works on identifying these inconsistencies and helping organizations semi-automate the process of cleaning and aligning different datasets. Additionally, our lab develops platforms that assist non-programmers running analysis on their data and enable data sharing and repeatability of data analysis so organizations can work together to improve data analysis.
