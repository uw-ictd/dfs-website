Often the most effective solutions for improving development health indicators are deceptively simple - the challenge is encouraging people to adopt new practices.
Behavior change theory has developed complex models of barriers, attitudes, social norms, and environmental factors which influence the adoption of new practices.
Our lab explores how ICTD interventions act as a catalyst for behavior change by providing access to information, forums to discuses new practices, and simple timely reminders.
In our projects we demonstrate that technology can amplify the influence of a single ASHA in Uttar Pradesh and extend the reach of a nurse in Nairobi.
Working with local and global partners we are working to demonstrate the effect of ICTD interventions on behavior change adoption.
