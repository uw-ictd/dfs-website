Conventional cutting-edge technology can be inappropriate for some low-resource contexts because of design assumptions such as constant connectivity to the cloud. Our lab designs, implements, and evaluates systems using various computing and communications technologies to support sustainable international development in resource-constrained environments. Many research challenges within the computing for development space intersect with many traditional areas of systems research (e.g., networking, system abstractions, mobility, security). However, research challenges in ICTD are driven by the on-the-ground realities that cause some conventional computing solutions to be inappropriate due to issues of: affordability, infrastructure constraints, institutional capacity, technical support, etc. Our lab builds solutions and reusable frameworks that provide out-of-the-box solutions that users can deploy in diverse contexts that can vary in the availability of connectivity, low-cost devices, and power. Research topics include: mobile systems and applications, low-cost wireless connectivity, intermittent networks and systems, power-efficient systems, low-cost computing devices, mechanisms for emergency and urgent communications, location-aware systems, middleware (e.g., caching and other mechanisms for minimizing complexity, energy, latency, storage), adapting content and applications for local languages, design and evaluation of applications and in-depth case studies (e.g., public health, microfinance, agriculture, e-governance, education, monitoring, disaster management).
