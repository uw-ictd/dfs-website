Overcoming barriers to financial inclusion requires partnerships between academic researchers and industry specialists to determine technological solutions that can be translated and widely adopted. To work toward such partnerships, on the 15th and 16th of November, 2017 the University of Washington’s Digital Financial Services Research Group (DFSRG), under the School of Computer Science and Engineering, and Information Technology University’s FinTech Center hosted the 2017 Digital Financial Services Workshop in Lahore, Pakistan. The workshop was co-located with the 2017 Information Communication and Technology for Development (ICTD) International Conference.

The goal of this workshop was to bring together members of the ICTD academic community with industry specialists of digital financial services to create opportunities for collaboration and knowledge sharing. The workshop bridged between the Pakistan FinTech community and the international ICTD research community through panel discussions, working groups, and position papers. The workshop also functioned as the starting point for creating a robust research agenda to address technology challenges for the adoption of Digital Financial Services in Pakistan and beyond. This workshop will be a model for other such international DFS workshops in the future.
